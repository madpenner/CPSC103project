I wanted to know, out of Cropland, Grazing, Forest, Carbon, and Fish, which of these factors had the highest footprint in contribution to a given countries Total Ecological Footprint

I used information from "2016 Global Ecological Footprint" , I took the data for each country name, theyre cropland footprint, grazing footprint, forest footprint, carbon footprint, and fish footprint.

This is really interesting to me because global ecological footprint is a subject most people know about, however, most people don't know what its made up of or what makes it as high as it is. I decided to take a subset of the information and figure out which factor was the highest contributor because I thought it would be interesting to know what is making our Global footprint as high as it is.
