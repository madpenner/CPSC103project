Term project
I wanted to know, out of Cropland, Grazing, Forest, Carbon, and Fish, which of these factors had the highest footprint in contribution to a given countries Total Ecological Footprint
I used information from "2016 Global Ecological Footprint" , I took the data for each country name, theyre cropland footprint, grazing footprint, forest footprint, carbon footprint, and fish footprint.
